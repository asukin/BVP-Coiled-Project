## BVP Mini Coiled Hackathon
Hi Matt and Coiled Team! Over the past quarter Bessemer has been working on a model to predict valuation step-ups in early stage companies. Yesterday, we had a mini hackathon where we ported a very small chunk of our model to this coiled-hosted notebook to see how Coiled and Dask work! As you can see in our MSE plot, we clearly didn't port over any hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model but hoping to do that after the holidays!
