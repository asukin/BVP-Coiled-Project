## BVP Mini Coiled Hackathon
Hi Matt and Coiled Team! Over the past quarter Bessemer has been working on a model to predict valuation step-ups in early stage companies. Yesterday, we had a mini hackathon where we ported a very small chunk of our model to this coiled-hosted notebook to see how Coiled and Dask work! We  didn't port over any hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model but hoping to do that after the holidays!

## Thank you and Credits
Thank you to those who helped, or who we used small code snippets or guidance from: Dask Gitter users, Jesse C Daniel (Data Science with Python and Dask), Kunal Dhariwal, Saifur Rahman. Since we put together and shared this project before it is complete we may be missing some and so we are sending love and credit to the whole Dask community!
