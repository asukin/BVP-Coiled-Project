## BVP Mini Coiled Hackathon
Hi Matt and Coiled Team! Over the past quarter Bessemer has been working on a model to predict valuation step-ups in early stage companies. Yesterday, we had a mini hackathon where we ported a very small chunk of our model to this coiled-hosted notebook to see how Coiled and Dask work! We  didn't port over any hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model but hoping to do that after the holidays!
